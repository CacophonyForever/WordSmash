a baby bed with sides and rockers
where something originated or was nurtured in its early existence
birth of a person
a trough that can be rocked back and forth
hold gently and carefully
bring up from infancy
hold or place in or as if in a cradle
cut grain with a cradle scythe
wash in a cradle
run with the stick
