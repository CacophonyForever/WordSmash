a strong flame that burns brightly
a cause of difficulty and suffering
noisy and unrestrained mischief
a light within the field of vision that is brighter than the brightness to which the eyes are adapted
a light-colored marking
shine brightly and intensively
shoot rapidly and repeatedly
burn brightly and intensely
move rapidly and as if blazing
indicate by marking trees with blazes
