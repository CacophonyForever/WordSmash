a short light gust of air
a lefteye flounder found in coastal waters from New England to Brazil
a strikeout resulting from the batter swinging at and missing the ball for the third strike
perceive by inhaling through the nose
drive or carry as if by a puff of air
strike out by swinging and missing the pitch charged as the third
smoke and exhale strongly
utter with a puff of air
