limbless scaly elongate reptile
a deceitful or treacherous person
a tributary of the Columbia River that rises in Wyoming and flows westward
a long faint constellation in the southern hemisphere near the equator stretching between Virgo and Cancer
something long, thin, and flexible that resembles a snake
move smoothly and sinuously, like a snake
form a snake-like pattern
move along a winding path
