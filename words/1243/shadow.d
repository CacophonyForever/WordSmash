an unilluminated area
something existing in perception only
a premonition of something adverse
an indication that something has been present
refuge from danger or observation
a dominating and pervasive presence
a spy employed to follow someone and report their movements
an inseparable companion
follow, usually without the person's knowledge
cast a shadow over
make appear small by comparison
