everything that exists anywhere
people in general
all of your experiences that determine how things appear to you
the 3rd planet from the sun
people in general considered as a whole
a part of the earth that can be considered separately
the concerns of this life as distinguished from heaven and the afterlife
all of the living human inhabitants of the earth
