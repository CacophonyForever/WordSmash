the swift release of a store of affective force
an almost pleasurable sensation of fright
something that causes you to experience a sudden intense feeling or sensation
cause to be thrilled by some perceptual input
feel sudden intense sensation or emotion
tremble convulsively, as from fear or excitement
fill with sublime emotion
